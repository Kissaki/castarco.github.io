Hi! My name is AndrÃ©s Correa Casablanca (but please, call me Andreu).

I've been developing software professionally for over 12 years, and
I'm currently working as a **Senior Software Engineer** at
[NearForm](https://nearform.com), while occasionally contributing to some
[FLOSS projects](/projects).

I love mathematics, science and engineering... but, more honestly: I basically
love everything, and I struggle when I have to choose what spend my time on. I
just have to prioritise somehow.
