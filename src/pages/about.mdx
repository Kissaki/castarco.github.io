Hi! My name is AndrÃ©s Correa Casablanca (but please, call me Andreu).

I've been developing software professionally for over 12 years, and
I'm currently working as a **Senior Software Engineer** at
[NearForm](https://nearform.com), while occasionally contributing to some
[FLOSS projects](/projects).

I love mathematics, science and engineering... but, more honestly: I fucking
love everything, and I struggle when I have to choose what spend my time on. I
just don't have enough time to do it all, so I have to prioritise somehow.

## Some boring history about this blog

This is (at least) the "4th edition" of my blog, which has changed its name,
domain name, design and many other aspects along its history...

During my first years of university I maintained a mildly popularÂ¹ blog about
software development at
[`labs.viricmind.org`](https://web.archive.org/web/20150101164015/http://labs.viricmind.org/)...
but I forgot to renovate the domain, and today is in the hands of a casino business ðŸ˜’.

Sadly, most of its content got lost, along with its inertia, and my investment
on it.

1. For the standards of that time, and in the scope of the Spanish-speaking
   community.
