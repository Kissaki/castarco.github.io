[Some of days ago](https://castarco.itch.io/fakelife/devlog/429445/first-release-pre-alpha)
I started to work on a small hobby project called [FakeLife](https://castarco.itch.io/fakelife),
a biologic evolution simulator. One feature I wanted to introduce is
[Brownian Motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_motion) for the small
inanimate particles that are suspended in the medium and serve as nutrients for
our fake algae (but also for the algae, as they can't move by themselves).

Before I explain my approach, a small disclaimer: it is not physically faithful,
I take some shortcuts because I'm only looking for a visually pleasant effect
and some "credible" source of randomness for the entire system.

## Preparation

We'll see two different approaches to the problem, but 1st, let's focus on what
they have in common.

We want to disable the effects of gravity on our
[`RigidBody2D`](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/physics/physics_introduction.html?highlight=rigidbody2d#rigidbody2d)
instances, as we can assume that we're observing a petry dish from above.

- If we're doing that from code, we have to set the `gravity_scale` property to
  `0`.
- We can also set that property to `0` using the inspector tab in the Godot IDE.

## Aproach 1: Dust/Mineral particles

The current version of FakeLife starts with a 16536 floating mineral particles
represented by a single pixel. Without careful optimizations this can impose a
heavy burden on our CPU.

I'm a newbie on [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) development, and all of its
abstractions make it difficult to implement highly performant code, so I opted
for cutting corners.

Although I'm using `RigidBody2D` so I can detect collisions with algae, I chose
to leave aside the interactions with the physics engine (stuff such as mass,
linear velocity, momentum) because it seems to be a bit slower than keeping
track of the velocity by myself, and I don't need that much realism for those
particles.

There's a catch though (besides leaving realism behind): detecting collisions is
a bit less reliable because the physics engine only has access to instant
positions, but not velocity. In any case, it's not a big problems in the context
of this project.

Ok, let's see the relevant code of my `MineralGrain` node, it couldn't be simpler!:

```julia
var velocity: Vector2 = Vector2(0.0, 0.0)


# Called every frame. 'delta' is the elapsed time since the previous frame.
func _process(delta: float) -> void:
	if randf() > 0.5:
		velocity = (
			velocity + Vector2.UP.rotated(TAU * randf())
		).limit_length(12.0)
	position = (position + velocity * delta).posmod(Globals.MAP_SIZE)
```

Some details worth mentioning, so you can be more aware of the tradeoffs I made:

- [TAU rules over PI](https://treelight.com/essays/ideas/the-way-of-the-tau-better-than-pi/),
  always.
- We could update the velocity every frame, we have a conditional clause only to
  do less work. The relevant part is that we always pick a random direction.
- The `velocity` variable is NOT the `linear_velocity` variable that is actually
  controlled by the physics engine, I do that on purpose, to squeeze some frames
  per second.
- The random changes in velocity direction are not evenly distributed accross
  time, they actually depend on the framerate... this is not good, but it's not
  terrible either.
- Instead of simulating friction, I just damp the maximum velocity a particle
  can have, as this is simpler & faster to compute.
- There are no collisions between the mineral particles, they can overlap in the
  2D space they inhabit. My parents even need a magnifying glass to see them.
- The final `.posmod` call is there just so particles can jump from one end of
  the map to the opposite side. This operation is actually quite expensive, if
  you don't need it, I suggest to replace it by a damping operation.

## Approach 2: Algae

In the case of algae I opted for a bit of extra realism, as they are much less
abundant, and I also need the collisions detection to be more reliable. As they
consume mineral particles, they grow in size and mass, and we can see how the
effects of brownian motion start to fade away.

As in the case of our mineral grain, we also use a `RigidBody2D` instance to
define our Algae node, but this time we'll use it's physics-related properties:

```julia
func _physics_process(delta: float) -> void:
	apply_central_impulse(Vector2.UP.rotated(TAU * randf()) * delta)
```

That's it! We can adjust norm of the impulse vector, or the mass of our algae
if we want to make our small algae more or less wobbly, but that's the basic
idea behind it.

As you can see, instead of directly affecting position, or even
`linear_velocity`, we apply a force that will translate into an acceleration,
and eventually into a velocity change & position change.

The computations chain is much longer, and it will take into account many more
details, such as mass, friction, collisions between algae or other big objects,
etc. So it is consequentially more CPU-intensive.

## Wrapping up

In following articles I'll talk about some Godot-related optimizations I've
applied to make the simulation a bit faster and other aspects of FakeLife.

In the meantime, I recommend you to check out other cool life/evolution
simulation projects:

- [The Life Engine](https://thelifeengine.net/)

See you soon!
