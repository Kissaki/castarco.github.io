Yesterday I released a
[new version of FakeLife (v0.0.2)](https://castarco.itch.io/fakelife/devlog/430853/v002-available)
that includes some performance improvements I want to talk about.

## Introduction

The 1st feature I implemented for FakeLife was having 16k floating mineral
grains (represented by a single pixel) following
[Brownian motion](/blog/2022/09/21/brownian-motion-on-godot/). Each one of them
was managed by a [`Sprite`](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_sprite.html)
node loaded with a 1x1px PNG texture, and it was FAST (~235fps for 16k objects on
a 1024x1024px canvas).

Sadly, shortly after I introduced algae that needed to detect collisions against
mineral grains, and this detail made it quite difficult to maintain the previous
frame rate. I had to use a
[`RigidBody2D`](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/physics/physics_introduction.html?highlight=rigidbody2d#rigidbody2d)
node, and nest the `Sprite` inside it, together with another
[`CollisionShape2D`](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_collisionshape2d.html) node.

Suddenly the frame rate had dropped to ~29fps 🐌.

## A failed attempt: Drawing primitives

It is known that having too many nodes in our scene can make Godot struggle
because of the added overhead. That's why some people propose bypassing them and
programming
[directly against Godot's servers](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/performance/using_servers.html).
I didn't try that yet, because I'm still learning Godot and I prefer to first
master its high level concepts.

What I did try (given that I couldn't get rid of the `RigidBody2D` because I
needed collisions) is to replace the PNG `Sprite` by relying on drawing
primitives, specifically `draw_primitive`, that allows us to draw single pixels.

The drawing primitives must be placed inside the special
[`CanvasItem`](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_canvasitem.html)'s
function `_draw` (which our objects inherit from), it looks like this:

```julia
func _draw() -> void:
  # It's trivial to set its coordinates to (0,0), because Godot takes care of
  # later applying a transformation/translation matrix.
  draw_primitive(
    PoolVector2Array([Vector2(0.0, 0.0)]), # position
    PoolColorArray([Color.darkslategray]), # color
    PoolVector2Array([Vector2(0.0, 0.0)])  # UVs (not needed in this context)
  )
```

Of course we can create constants for these parameters, so we don't have to
construct the objects every time, but this detail is not what should worry us
right now.

It turns out this solution is terrible, it's even slower than loading PNG
textures! In my case, the frame rate dropped to 12fps.

Why is that? Well, it turns out that `Sprite` takes advantage of
[calls batching](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/performance/batching.html),
while `draw_primitive`
[doesn't](https://godotengine.org/article/gles2-renderer-optimization-2d-batching)
(at least for single pixels).

## Second attempt: Rectangles

If `draw_primitive` doesn't take advantage of batching, do we have any other
"low level" function that does? Yes, `draw_rect`:

```julia
# We cache these 2 objects, as we'll reuse them a lot
const rect = Rect2(0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0)
const color = Color(0.25, 0.25, 0.25)

func _draw() -> void:
	draw_rect(rect, color) # Takes advantage of batching :D
```

The performance gain is noticeable, but humble. We go from ~29fps to ~32fps,
that's a 10% improvement. Not bad.

To recap:
`draw_rect` faster than `nested Sprite` faster than `draw_primitive`.

## Other considerations

As explained in my [previous article](/blog/2022/09/21/brownian-motion-on-godot/),
I avoided using the Godot's physics engine because of its performance impact.

There are some cards I still have in my sleeve in order to further improve the
simulation's frame rate:

- Using Godot's servers, instead of having an individual node per particle.
- Implementing some scripts in C# instead of using GDScript. I don't have much
  faith in this approach, but it could be interesting to try, even if it's just
  for the learning experience.
- Going even further, [Rust bindings](https://godot-rust.github.io/) perhaps?

[Bevy Engine](https://bevyengine.org/) is an option I'm also considering, but
I prefer to work first with a less performant engine to be sure that I'm not
doing anything terribly wrong from a computational complexity perspective.

## End

That's it for today! In next articles I'll probably write about some other
problems I've had to face while developing FakeLife, such as designing genes
that allow for the creation of multicellular organisms as an adaptive response.

See you soon!
