Although ES modules [were introduced with ES6](https://gist.github.com/jkrems/769a8cd8806f7f57903b641c74b5f08a)
(first spec details around 2015, browser support around 2017, final spec details
around 2018, full suport in Node 12.17.0 around 2020), we still live in a world
where CommonJS dominates the JS landscape, and it's difficult to imagine the day
when it will be gone.

Some developers are becoming impatient and are trying to
["force"](https://github.com/rickbergfalk/postgrator/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#february-21-2022)
[it](https://github.com/node-fetch/node-fetch/releases/tag/v3.0.0)
[on](https://github.com/sindresorhus/execa/releases/tag/v6.0.0)
[the](https://github.com/wooorm/franc/releases/tag/6.0.0)
[rest](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/releases/tag/14.0.0)
[of](https://github.com/d3/d3/releases/tag/v7.0.0)
[us](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ow/releases/tag/v1.0.0). That's a bad idea.
I'll try to tell you why, and what we can try to do in case we're developing
TypeScript libraries consumed by 3rd parties.

## Why ESM-Only is a bad idea today

While it is true that we should try to migrate our code to ESM, rushing it on
open source libraries might be counterproductive.

Users are not entirely free to choose their dependencies, sometimes they won't
be able to find alternatives. They can find themselves in some of the next
situations:

- Your lib is ESM-only, but all their other dependencies also support ESM. Happy
  path! 🍾🎉
- Your lib is ESM-only, but some other dependency is still CJS-only...
  - If they can replace the CJS-only deps, good 😐...
  - But that's not always possible! 💩 So now they're stuck with an old version
    of your library, possibly missing not only new features, but also bug and
    security fixes 💣.
- Your lib is ESM-only... and they are in charge of a library that intends to
  offer CJS & ESM support at the same time during a transition period.
  - If they can replace your lib, good... but you lost users 🤷.
  - If not, well, they either break their compatibility promise to their users,
    or have to risk missing bug & security fixes for a long time on some of
    their transitive dependencies 💣.

All of these problems are not only in our imagination, we've suffered them in
some of our projects, and some library maintainers wrote about
[their cases](https://formidable.com/blog/2022/victory-esm/).

Overall, the ESM-only approach won't help to speed up the transition, but only
to make it less smooth, and much more painful... probably even slower!

Nobody remembers anymore the [pains](https://lwn.net/Articles/843660/) of the Python3
[migration](https://stackoverflow.blog/2019/11/14/why-is-the-migration-to-python-3-taking-so-long/)?
It was too slow, yes, but the main failure was that for some years
there was no proper transition path! (Nope, the
[`six`](https://pypi.org/project/six/) library wasn't enough).

## Generating ESM code from TypeScript, 1st try

The simplest way is to apply the following steps:

1. Add the `"type": "module"` entry to our `package.json` file.
2. Set the following values in your `tsconfig.json` file:
   ```json
   {
   	"compilerOptions": {
   		"module": "ES2022",
   		"target": "ES2022",
   		"moduleResolution": "Node16"
   	}
   }
   ```
3. In your relative imports, always remember to add the module file extension:

   ```ts
   // Instead of
   import { something } from "./relative/path";

   // Write
   import { something } from "./relative/path.js";
   ```

I said this was the simplest way, but not the best one. Unfortunately, you're
going to suffer some of its shortcommings quite soon.

- Setting `package.json`'s `type` to `module` causes all JS files to be
  interpreted as ESM. If we do nothing about it, then we loose support for CJS.
  - Even if we create 2 different `tsconfig.json` files, one to emit CJS, and
    another one to emit ESM, we need a way to tell them apart so we can load
    them properly.
- We might suffer some problems with our test runner (such as Jest) or other
  tools we use. These can be caused by:
  - the `type` property specified on our `package.json` file.
  - the `moduleResolution` property specified in our `tsconfig.json` file.

## Weird TS features that seem useful... but aren't

Because NodeJS has supported CommonJS since forever, it had to introduce a
way to know when to load files as ESM. It has 2 mechanisms:

- We are already familiar with the 1st one (setting `package.json`'s `type` to
  `module`)
- The second mechanism is to use the extensions `.cjs` and `.mjs`, and is
  complementary to the 1st one (overrides the default set by `package.json`'s
  `type`).

TypeScript, in recent versions, added a new feature: We can use the extensions
`.cts` and `.mts` for our source files, and they get compiled to `.cjs` or `.mjs`.
Although this sounds potentially useful, it is only if we don't need to
generate both variants at the same time. Not our case.

## Generating ESM & CJS at the same time, 2nd try

First, let's focus on our `package.json` file:

```json
{
	// "main" & "module" are redundant, but we add them "just in case".
	"main": "./dist/cjs/index.cjs", // CJS entry point
	"module": "./dist/esm/index.mjs", // ESM entry point
	"types": "./dist/esm/index.d.ts", // Exported types

	// This is where the real magic happens. It tells Node and other
	// tools how to load our code when running in CJS or ESM mode.
	"exports": {
		// We could move what we have inside "." directly into "exports",
		// but doing it like this is more general, and allows us to be more
		// specific about how do we load specific paths from our package.
		".": {
			"import": "./dist/esm/index.mjs",
			"require": "./dist/cjs/index.cjs",
			"node": "./dist/cjs/index.cjs" // Equivalent to "require"
		},

		// Example taken from "@lyrasearch/plugin-astro":
		"./clientside": {
			"import": "./dist/esm/clientside.mjs",
			"require": "./dist/cjs/clientside.cjs",
			"node": "./dist/cjs/clientside.cjs"
		}
	}
}
```

Ok, the consumers are already able to load the code properly, but we
still have to generate it.

Let's create two different configuration files for our TypeScript
compiler:

```json
// tsconfig.cjs.json
{
	// We'll keep all the common details in a base file
	"extends": "./tsconfig.base.json",
	"compilerOptions": {
		"module": "CommonJS",
		"target": "ES2022",
		"outDir": "./dist/cjs"
	}
}
```

```json
// tsconfig.esm.json
{
	// We'll keep all the common details in a base file
	"extends": "./tsconfig.base.json",
	"compilerOptions": {
		"module": "ES2022",
		// For moduleResolution, we could use NodeNext or Node16 as well,
		// but some tools that are still not fully compatible :( .
		"moduleResolution": "Node",
		"target": "ES2022",
		"outDir": "./dist/esm"
	}
}
```

Now, we can call tsc specifying which config file has to be used:

```bash
tsc -p ./tsconfig.cjs.json # For CJS generation
tsc -p ./tsconfig.esm.json # For ESM generation
```

Are we done yet? Almost!

## Final details, 3rd try

Remember that ESM files need their `import` statements to specify the module
file extension, as follows:

```ts
// Instead of
import { something } from "./relative/path";

// Write
import { something } from "./relative/path.js";
```

At this point, most of us don't have to do anything else. BUT.

If for any reason you want to support Node versions older than 12.7.0, then
you'll have to apply some extra dirty tricks because the `exports` field in the
`package.json` field was not yet supported before that version.

If you decide to use `.mjs` & `.cjs` extensions, they you'll have problems with
the previous changes suggested for the `import` statements. This can be solved
by not adding the extensions in the TS source code, and then applying a later
post-processing step, with tools such as `awk` or `sed`.

Here you can see an ugly script I wrote some time ago. It does its job, but I
regret having written it, my sole reason for it was that I was using `.cjs` &
`.mjs` extensions, which are not really necessary if we properly configure our
`package.json` file.

```sh
#!/bin/sh
# build_esm.sh

set -e;

# Compile
tsc -p ./tsconfig.esm.json;

# Sed works differently depending on whether it's the BSD or GNU variant
if [ "$(sed --version 2>/dev/null | grep GNU | wc -l)" -gt "0" ]; then
	SED_VARIANT="GNU"
else
	SED_VARIANT="BSD"
fi

# Process source files
for i in $( ls ./dist/esm/*.js ); do
	# Rename source files
	mv $i ${i%.*}.mjs;

	if [ "${SED_VARIANT}" = "BSD" ]; then
		# Fix map references inside source files
		sed -E -i '' 's/\/\/#[[:space:]]sourceMappingURL=(.+)\.js\.map/\/\/# sourceMappingURL=\1.mjs.map/g' "${i%.*}.mjs";

		# Fix imports in ESM files (we first remove existing extensions)
		sed -E -i '' 's/[[:space:]]+from[[:space:]]+'"'"'\.\/(.+)\.m?js'"'"';/ from '"'"'.\/\1'"'"';/g' "${i%.*}.mjs";
		sed -E -i '' 's/[[:space:]]+from[[:space:]]+'"'"'\.\/(.+)'"'"';/ from '"'"'.\/\1.mjs'"'"';/g' "${i%.*}.mjs";
	else
		# Fix map references inside source files
		sed -Ei 's/\/\/# sourceMappingURL=(.+)\.js\.map/\/\/# sourceMappingURL=\1.mjs.map/g' "${i%.*}.mjs";

		# Fix imports in ESM files (we first remove existing extensions)
		sed -Ei 's/\s+from\s+'"'"'\.\/(.+)\.m?js'"'"';/ from '"'"'.\/\1'"'"';/g' "${i%.*}.mjs";
		sed -Ei 's/\s+from\s+'"'"'\.\/(.+)'"'"';/ from '"'"'.\/\1.mjs'"'"';/g' "${i%.*}.mjs";
	fi;
done;

# Process source maps
for i in $( ls ./dist/esm/*.js.map ); do
	# Rename sourcemap files
	ii="${i%.*}"
	mv $i "${ii%.*}.mjs.map";

	# Fix source file refences inside maps
	if [ "${SED_VARIANT}" = "BSD" ]; then
		sed -E -i '' 's/"file":"(.+)\.js"/"file":"\1.mjs"/g' "${ii%.*}.mjs.map";
	else
		sed -Ei 's/"file":"(.+)\.js"/"file":"\1.mjs"/g' "${ii%.*}.mjs.map";
	fi;
done
```

As you can see, this doesn't look good 🤢 (and I say it being me who wrote it),
so try to stay away from this kind of hacks. It could be simpler if GNU & BSD
command line tools didn't had so many subtle differences, but that would be too
easy, right?
