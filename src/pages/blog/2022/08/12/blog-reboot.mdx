So... I did it again. I rebuilt my blog from scratch, again. This is (at least)
the 4th time I do that.

## A long trip

I don't recall if I started writting at Blogspot and then moved to Blogger, or
the other way around. It doesn't matter, it was a good start, but it sucked.

So I eventually jumped to the much more powerful `wordpress.com`, and at some
point I felt it wasn't enough. I wanted to customise my blog even more, and to
get rid of their annoying advertisements.

That's when I decided to host my own wordpress instance
([archived here](https://web.archive.org/web/20150101164015/http://labs.viricmind.org/)),
and... oh boy.

The maintenance cost was tremendous: updating wordpress, its plugins, the
customised theme I created, PHP, Apache (Nginx some time later), the operating
system underneath... and yet, that wasn't enough.

Every now and then a new zero-day bug would come up, and it turns out some ISIS
operatives (yep, **fucking ISIS**, no kidding here) hacked my blog to deface it
and place their disgusting propaganda.

So there was I again, looking for alternatives.

## Static Sites Generation

I decided to go for static site generation. The appeal was evident, they could
be hosted at a much lesser cost, and the attack surface was much smaller too.

[Pelican](https://getpelican.com/) was my 1st choice, but it didn't cut it.
Although not much better, [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) was my final choice
back then, as it was nicely integrated with Github Pages.

My problem with Pelican & Jekyll, though, is that both of them are a
dependencies nightmare because of how much of a disgrace is package management
in Python and Ruby ecosystems. And it only gets worse when your computer stops
working and you have to configure a new one, or when you have to switch between
machines for any other reason.

Besides, keeping track of tooling versions can be a problem too. That's why,
even if I used [Zola](https://www.getzola.org) for some other websites (such as
[Avatar-CLI](https://avatar-cli.dev)'s one) because it's just a single binary, I
wasn't entirely content with it.

## Hi, Astro!

Here we go, I rewrote my blog on top of [Astro](https://astro.build/). I
considered using [Ink's theme](https://astro-ink.vercel.app/), which seems nice,
but this time I took the opportunity to practice some of my long forgotten &
rusty frontend abilities (I copied from it anyway).

And what can I say? so far, it has been awesome. I can easily pin all versions
under Git version control, it's wonderfully integrated with
[SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/), [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/),
and for a static site generation tool, it's really flexible (like no others I
tried before).

There's a lot I still want to to, leaving aside the clearly improvable style,
I want to apply some optimisations to CSS, JS, & fonts; configuring the RSS
& sitemap generation... but I also have other experiments in mind, like
integrating [Lyra](https://lyrajs.io/) to statically index the site's content.

So, I'm leaving it here for today, I'm looking forward to write about all that
stuff!
